ðŸ”¨ ExpressJS â€“ Adopt A Pet
This project uses the Express framework to create a http server for a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.

The site will have three main pages:

- The homepage
- A page that lists all available pets of a given type of animal
- A page that displays a profile page for an individual pet
